    "####    1.What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages\n",
    "-   Interpreted languages execute code line by line using an interpreter, making debugging easier but slowing execution.\n",
    "    -       Examples include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby.\n",
    "    -   They are platform-independent since they don’t need compilation but require an interpreter to run.\n",
    "-   Compiled languages convert the entire code into machine code before execution, making them faster but requiring a compilation step.\n",
    "    -       Examples include C, C++, and Rust.\n",
    "    -   These programs run without needing a separate compiler at runtime.\n",
    "    -   Compiled languages are generally more efficient but harder to debug due to pre-execution translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "####    2.What is exception handling in Python?\n",
    "-   Exception handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors and prevent program crashes.\n",
    "-   Python provides the try, except, finally, and raise keywords to handle exceptions.\n",
    "-   It helps manage errors like dividing by zero, file not found, or invalid inputs.\n",
    "-   Without exception handling, unexpected errors can terminate a program.\n",
    "-   The try block contains the risky code, and the except block catches exceptions.\n",
    "-   The finally block ensures cleanup operations are performed.\n",
    "-   It improves program stability and user experience by gracefully handling failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "####    3.What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
    "-   The finally block always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.\n",
    "-   It is used for cleanup tasks, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "-   Even if the program crashes due to an unhandled exception, the finally block will still execute.\n",
    "-   It ensures proper resource management and prevents memory leaks.\n",
    "    -       Example:\n",
    "    -       try:\n",
    "    -           f = open(\"data.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "    -       except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "    -           print(\"File not found\")\n",
    "    -       finally:\n",
    "    -           f.close()  #Ensures file is closed even if an error occurs\n",
    "-   The finally block is useful in database connections, network communication, and file handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "####    4.What is logging in Python?\n",
    "-   Logging is a way to track events, warnings, and errors during program execution.\n",
    "-   It replaces print() statements with structured logs for better debugging and monitoring.\n",
    "-   Python provides the logging module to generate logs at different levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).\n",
    "-   Logs can be stored in files, printed to the console, or sent to monitoring tools.\n",
    "    -       Example:\n",
    "    -       import logging\n",
    "    -       logging.warning(\"This is a warning message\")\n",
    "-   Logging is essential for debugging, performance monitoring, and maintaining large-scale applications.\n",
    "-   It helps in identifying issues without modifying the program flow.\n",
    "-   It is a best practice to use logging instead of print() statements for debugging purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "####    5.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
    "-   The __del__ method is a destructor that gets called when an object is deleted.\n",
    "-   It is used to perform cleanup tasks, such as closing file handles or releasing resources.\n",
    "    -       Example:\n",
    "    -       class Sample:\n",
    "    -           def __del__(self):\n",
    "    -               print(\"Object destroyed\")\n",
    "    -       obj = Sample()\n",
    "    -       del obj  #Triggers __del__ method\n",
    "-   Python’s garbage collector automatically calls __del__ when an object is no longer referenced.\n",
    "-   However, relying too much on __del__ can lead to unpredictable behavior if garbage collection timing varies.\n",
    "-   It is rarely used explicitly but can be useful for managing external resources.\n",
    "-   It is a special method that gets called when an object is about to be destroyed.\n",
    "-   It is used to perform any necessary cleanup or finalization tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "####    6.What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
    "-   The `import` statement loads an entire module into the namespace.\n",
    "    -       Example:\n",
    "    -       import math\n",
    "    -       print(math.sqrt(16))  #Using module.function_name\n",
    "-   The `from` ... `import` statement imports specific functions or classes from a module.\n",
    "    -       Example:\n",
    "    -       from math import sqrt\n",
    "    -       print(sqrt(16))  #Direct function call without module prefix\n",
    "-   The first approach keeps the namespace organized but requires prefixing functions with the module name.\n",
    "-   The second approach reduces code length but can cause name conflicts if multiple functions have the same name.\n",
    "-   It is a best practice to use the first approach for larger modules and the second for smaller modules or when working with frequently used functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "####    7.How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
    "-   Python allows handling multiple exceptions using a tuple in except or multiple except blocks.\n",
    "    -   -   Example of using a tuple:\n",
    "    -       try:\n",
    "    -           num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    -           result = 10 / num\n",
    "    -       except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:\n",
    "    -           print(\"Error:\", e)\n",
    "    -   -   Example of multiple except blocks:\n",
    "    -       try:\n",
    "    -           num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    -       except ValueError:\n",
    "    -           print(\"Invalid input, enter a number\")\n",
    "    -       except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    -           print(\"Cannot divide by zero\")\n",
    "-   Using multiple except blocks helps handle specific errors differently.\n",
    "-   A general except Exception block can be used to catch any error.\n",
    "-   It is a best practice to handle specific exceptions first and then a general exception at the end.\n",
    "-   It is a good practice to handle exceptions in a way that makes sense for the specific use case and provides useful information to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "####    8.What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
    "-   The with statement ensures proper file handling by automatically closing the file.\n",
    "    -   -   Example:\n",
    "    -       with open(\"file.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    -           content = file.read()\n",
    "    -   -   Without with, you need to manually close the file:\n",
    "    -       file = open(\"file.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "    -       content = file.read()\n",
    "    -       file.close()  # Risk of forgetting to close\n",
    "-   The with statement prevents memory leaks and ensures that file descriptors are released.\n",
    "-   It is safer and more efficient, especially when working with large files.\n",
    "-   It is a best practice to use the with statement when handling files in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "####    9.What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
    "-   Multithreading allows multiple threads to run within the same process, sharing memory.\n",
    "-   It is useful for I/O-bound tasks like web scraping and file handling.\n",
    "-   Multiprocessing creates separate processes, each with its own memory space.\n",
    "-   It is useful for CPU-bound tasks like machine learning and image processing.\n",
    "    -   -   Example using threading:\n",
    "    -       import threading\n",
    "    -       t1 = threading.Thread(target=task)\n",
    "    -       t1.start()\n",
    "    -   -   Example using multiprocessing:\n",
    "    -       import multiprocessing\n",
    "    -       p1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=task)\n",
    "    -       p1.start()\n",
    "-   Multiprocessing is more powerful but consumes more system resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "####    10.What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
    "-   Helps in debugging by recording errors and warnings.\n",
    "-   Provides real-time monitoring of an application’s behavior.\n",
    "-   Stores logs in files for later analysis.\n",
    "-   Supports different logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).\n",
    "-   Reduces dependency on print() statements, making the code more maintainable.\n",
    "-   Can be configured to send logs to remote servers for centralized logging.\n",
    "-   Allows filtering logs based on severity levels, improving efficiency.\n",
    "-   It is a best practice to use logging in a program for better error handling and debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "####    11.What is memory management in Python?\n",
    "-   Memory management in Python involves the allocation and deallocation of memory during program execution.\n",
    "-   Python uses automatic memory management, meaning the developer doesn’t have to manually allocate or free memory.\n",
    "-   It is handled by Python’s garbage collector, which removes unused objects from memory.\n",
    "-   Python uses reference counting, where an object is deleted when no references to it remain.\n",
    "-   Generational garbage collection optimizes performance by categorizing objects based on their lifespan.\n",
    "-   The gc module allows manual control of garbage collection if needed.\n",
    "-   Proper memory management improves program efficiency and prevents memory leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "####    12.What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
    "-   Identify the potential exception using try-except blocks.\n",
    "-   Handle the exception using a specific exception type in the except block.\n",
    "-   Provide a meaningful error message to the user.\n",
    "-   Optionally, log the exception for debugging purposes.\n",
    "-   Re-raise the exception if it cannot be handled.\n",
    "-   Use finally block to release resources.\n",
    "-   Use try-except-finally block to ensure cleanup code is executed.\n",
    "    -       Example:\n",
    "    -       try:\n",
    "    -           x = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    -           print(10 / x)\n",
    "    -       except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    -           print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "    -       except ValueError:\n",
    "    -           print(\"Invalid input, enter a number.\")\n",
    "    -       finally:\n",
    "    -           print(\"Execution completed.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "####    13.Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
    "-   Ensures efficient use of system resources by preventing memory wastage.\n",
    "-   Reduces memory leaks by automatically cleaning up unused objects.\n",
    "-   Improves program performance by freeing up memory for new allocations.\n",
    "-   Helps manage large data structures like lists and dictionaries without crashing.\n",
    "-   Python’s garbage collection prevents excessive memory consumption.\n",
    "-   Poor memory management can lead to out-of-memory errors in resource-intensive applications.\n",
    "-   Essential for applications dealing with big data, deep learning, or high-performance computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "####    14.What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
    "-   The try block contains code that might raise an error.\n",
    "-   If an error occurs, the except block catches and handles it, preventing a crash.\n",
    "    -       Example:\n",
    "    -       try:\n",
    "    -           print(10 / 0)  #Causes ZeroDivisionError\n",
    "    -       except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    -           print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "-   Multiple except blocks can handle different exceptions separately.\n",
    "-   A general except Exception block can catch all exceptions.\n",
    "-   Helps maintain code stability and improves user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "####    15.How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
    "-   Python uses automatic garbage collection to free memory occupied by unused objects.\n",
    "-   It relies on reference counting, where an object is deleted if no references remain.\n",
    "    -       Example:\n",
    "    -       import gc\n",
    "    -       gc.collect()  #Manually triggers garbage collection\n",
    "-   Python uses a generational garbage collector, categorizing objects into three generations based on age.\n",
    "-   Older objects are collected less frequently than newer ones to optimize performance.\n",
    "-   The gc module allows developers to enable, disable, or manually trigger garbage collection.\n",
    "-   Helps prevent memory leaks in long-running programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "####    16.What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
    "-   The else block executes only if no exceptions occur in the try block.\n",
    "-   Helps separate normal execution from exception handling.\n",
    "    -       Example:\n",
    "    -       try:\n",
    "    -           num = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "    -           print(\"Valid number:\", num)\n",
    "    -       except ValueError:\n",

    "    -       else:\n",
    "    -           print(\"No errors occurred.\")\n",
    "-   Improves code readability by keeping error-free logic separate.\n",
    "-   Useful when some operations should only run if no exceptions happen.\n",
    "-   Ensures that code within the else block is executed only when the try block completes successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "####    17.What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
    "-   DEBUG – Detailed debugging information, used during development.\n",
    "-   INFO – General informational messages about program execution.\n",
    "-   WARNING – Indicates potential problems but doesn’t stop execution.\n",
    "-   ERROR – Records serious issues that need attention.\n",
    "-   CRITICAL – Records severe errors that might cause program failure.\n",
    "    -       Example:\n",
    "    -       import logging\n",
    "    -       logging.basicConfig(level=logging.WARNING)\n",
