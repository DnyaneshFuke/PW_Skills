    "####    1.What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
    "-   OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.\n",
    "-   It is a programming paradigm where concepts are represented as \"objects\" that have data fields (attributes) and methods (functions).\n",
    "-   OOP focuses on organizing code into reusable and modular components.\n",
    "-   The main principles of OOP are encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.\n",
    "-   -   Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit (class). It helps protect the data from outside interference.\n",
    "-   -   Inheritance allows a new class (child class) to inherit the properties and behaviors of an existing class (parent class).\n",
    "-   -   Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface, enabling a method to have different behaviors.\n",
    "-   -   Abstraction hides complex implementation details, showing only the essential features of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####    2.What is a class in OOP?\n",
    "-   A class is a blueprint or a template that defines the properties and behavior of an object.\n",
    "-   It is a collection of data fields (attributes) and methods (functions) that define the characteristics of an object.\n",
    "-   A class is essentially a design pattern or a template that defines the structure and behavior of an object.\n",
    "-   Classes are the building blocks of object-oriented programming and are used to create objects.\n",
    "    -       Example:\n",
    "    -       class Dog:\n",
    "    -           def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
    "    -               self.name = name\n",
    "    -               self.breed = breed\n",
    "    -           def bark(self):\n",
    "    -               print(f\"{self.name} says woof!\")\n",
    "    -       dog1 = Dog(\"Buddy\", \"Golden Retriever\")\n",
    "    -       dog1.bark()  #Output: Buddy says woof!\n",
    "####    3.What is an object in OOP?\n",
    "-   An object is an instance of a class and has its own set of attributes (data).\n",
    "-   It is a concrete entity that has its own set of attributes (data) and methods (functions).\n",
    "-   An object is created based on the structure defined in its class.\n",
    "    -       Example:\n",
    "    -       class Dog:\n",
    "    -           def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
    "    -               self.name = name\n",
    "    -               self.breed = breed\n",
    "    -           def bark(self):\n",
    "    -       dog1 = Dog(\"Buddy\", \"Golden Retriever\")\n",
    "    -       print(dog1.name)  #Output:Buddy\n",
    "####    4.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
    "-   Abstraction is the practice of exposing only the necessary information to the outside world while hiding the implementation details.\n",
    "    -       Example: A car’s dashboard shows the speed and fuel levels, but you don't need to know how the engine works.\n",
    "-   Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, called a class or object.\n",
    "    -       Example: A class Car may have methods like start_engine() and drive(), which operate on the internal state (data) of the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "####    5.What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
    "-   Dunder methods (also called magic methods) are special methods in Python classes that are surrounded by double underscores on both sides (e.g., __init__, __str__, __repr__).\n",
    "-   They are used for operator overloading and other special operations.\n",
    "    -       Example: The __add__ method allows the use of the + operator on custom objects:\n",
    "    -       class Point:\n",
    "    -           def __init__(self, x, y):\n",
    "    -               self.x = x\n",
    "    -               self.y = y\n",
    "    -           def __add__(self, other):\n",
    "    -               return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)\n",
    "    -       p1 = Point(1, 2)\n",
    "    -       p2 = Point(3, 4)\n",
    "    -       p3 = p1 + p2  # Calls __add__\n",
    "    -       print(p3.x, p3.y)  #Output: 4 6\n",
    "\n",
    "####    6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
    "-   Inheritance allows a new class (subclass) to inherit the properties and behaviors of an existing class (parent class).\n",
    "-   It promotes code reuse and creates a hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "    -       Example:\n",
    "    -       class Animal:\n",
    "    -           def speak(self):\n",
    "    -               print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
    "    -       class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    -           def speak(self):\n",
    "    -               print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
    "    -       dog = Dog()\n",
    "    -       dog.speak()  #Output: Dog barks\n",
    "\n",
    "####    7.What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
    "-   Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on multiple forms, depending on the\n",
    "context in which it is used.\n",
    "-   It is the ability of an object to behave differently in different situations.\n",
    "-   It is the ability of an object to be treated as if it were of a different class\n",
    "-   It is the ability of an object to have multiple methods with the same name but different\n",
    "implementations.\n",
    "-   Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
    "-   It enables a method to have different behaviors depending on the object calling it.\n",
    "    -       Example:    -   \n",
    "    -       class Animal:\n",
    "    -           def speak(self):\n",
    "    -               print(\"Animal speaks\")\n",
    "    -       class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    -           def speak(self):\n",
    "    -               print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
    "    -       class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    -           def speak(self):\n",
    "    -               print(\"Cat meows\")\n",
    "    -       animals = [Dog(), Cat()]\n",
    "    -       for animal in animals:\n",
    "    -           animal.speak()  #Output: Dog barks, Cat meows\n",
    "\n",
    "####    8.How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
    "-   Encapsulation is achieved in Python by using classes and objects.\n",
    "-   Encapsulation in Python is achieved using classes and objects, and private variables and methods.\n",
    "-   Variables and methods with double underscores (__) are considered private and are not accessible directly from outside the class.\n",
    "    -       Example:\n",
    "    -       class Person:\n",
    "    -           def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "    -               self.__name = name\n",
    "    -           def get_name(self):\n",
    "    -               return self.__name\n",
    "    -       person = Person(\"John\")\n",
    "    -       print(person.get_name())  #Output: John\n",
    "\n",
    "####    9.What is a constructor in Python?\n",
    "-   A constructor is a special method in Python classes that is used to initialize objects.\n",
    "-   The constructor method is called when an object is created from a class.\n",
    "-   It is used to set the initial state of an object.\n",
    "-   It is used to initialize the attributes of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -       Example:\n",
    "    -       class Person:\n",
    "    -           def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "    -               self.name = name\n",
    "    -               self.age = age\n",
    "    -       person = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
    "\n",
    "####    10.What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
    "-   Class methods are methods that are bound to the class rather than the instance of the class.\n",
    "-   They are used to define a method that is shared by all instances of a class.\n",
    "-   They are used to define a method that operates on the class itself, rather than on an\n",
    "instance of the class.\n",
    "-   Static methods are methods that belong to a class rather than an instance of the class.\n",
    "-   They are used to define a method that is shared by all instances of a class.\n",
    "-   They are used to define a method that operates on the class itself, rather than on an\n",
    "instance of the class.\n",
    "    -       Edit\n",
    "    -       class MyClass:\n",
    "    -           @classmethod\n",
    "    -           def class_method(cls):\n",
    "    -               print(\"This is a class method.\")\n",
    "    -           @staticmethod\n",
    "    -           def static_method():\n",
    "    -               print(\"This is a static method.\")\n",
    "    -       MyClass.class_method()  #Output: This is a class method.\n",
    "    -       MyClass.static_method()  #Output: This is a static method.\n",
    "\n",
    "####    11.What is method overloading in Python?\n",
    "-   Method overloading is a feature in Python that allows multiple methods with the same name to be\n",
    "defined, but with different parameters.\n",
    "-   It is a way to provide multiple implementations of a method, depending on the number and types\n",
    "of arguments passed to it.\n",
    "-   It is a way to provide a single interface to a method, but with different implementations\n",
    "depending on the context in which it is used.\n",
    "    -       Example:\n",
    "    -       class Math:\n",
    "    -           def add(self, a, b=0):\n",
    "    -               return a + b\n",
    "    -       math = Math()\n",
    "    -       print(math.add(5))  #Output: 5\n",
    "    -       print(math.add(5, 3))  #Output: 8\n",
    "\n",
    "####    12.What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
    "-   Method overriding is a feature in OOP that allows a subclass to provide a different implementation of\n",
    "a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
    "-   It is a way to provide a new implementation of a method that is already defined in a\n",
    "superclass.\n",
    "-   It is a way to provide a different behavior for a method that is already defined in a\n",
    "superclass.\n",
    "    -       Example:\n",
    "    -       class Animal:\n",
    "    -           def sound(self):\n",
    "    -               print(\"Animal sound\")\n",
    "    -       class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    -           def sound(self):\n",
    "    -               print(\"Bark\")\n",
    "    -       dog = Dog()\n",
    "    -       dog.sound()  #Output: Bark\n",
    "\n",
    "####    13.What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
    "-   A property decorator in Python is used to define methods that get, set, or delete an attribute of a class while maintaining an object's encapsulation.\n",
    "-   It allows a method to be accessed like an attribute while adding additional functionality to getting, setting, or deleting the attribute.\n",
    "-   The @property decorator is used to create a getter method, @<property_name>.setter for the setter, and @<property_name>.deleter for deleting the property.\n",
    "    -       Example:\n",
    "    -       class Circle:\n",
    "    -           def __init__(self, radius):\n",
    "    -               self._radius = radius\n",
    "    -       \n",
    "    -           @property\n",
    "    -           def radius(self):\n",
    "    -               return self._radius\n",
    "    -       \n",
    "    -           @radius.setter\n",
    "    -           def radius(self, value):\n",
    "    -               if value < 0:\n",
    "    -                   raise ValueError(\"Radius cannot be negative.\")\n",
    "    -               self._radius = value\n",
    "    -       \n",
    "    -           @radius.deleter\n",
    "    -           def radius(self):\n",
    "    -               print(\"Deleting radius...\")\n",
    "    -               del self._radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    -       # Example usage:\n",
    "    -       circle = Circle(5)\n",
    "    -       print(circle.radius)  #Calls the getter\n",
    "    -       circle.radius = 10    #Calls the setter\n",
    "    -       del circle.radius     #Calls the delete\n",
    "\n",
    "####    14.Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
    "-   Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, promoting flexibility in code.\n",
    "-   It enables methods to be written that can work with objects of different classes, reducing complexity and making the code more scalable.\n",
    "With polymorphism, the same method or function can have different behaviors based on the object calling it.\n",
    "    -       Example:\n",
    "    -       class Animal:\n",
    "    -           def make_sound(self):\n",
    "    -               print(\"Some generic animal sound\")\n",
    "    -       \n",
    "    -       class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    -           def make_sound(self):\n",
    "    -               print(\"Woof!\")\n",
    "    -       \n",
    "    -       class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    -           def make_sound(self):\n",
    "    -               print(\"Meow!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    -       def make_animal_sound(animal: Animal):\n",
    "    -           animal.make_sound()\n",
    "\n",
    "    -       # Polymorphism in action\n",
    "    -       dog = Dog()\n",
    "    -       cat = Cat()\n",
    "\n",
    "    -       make_animal_sound(dog)  #Outputs: Woof!\n",
    "    -       make_animal_sound(cat)  #Outputs: Meow!\n",
    "\n",
    "####    15.What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
    "-   An abstract class in Python is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is\n",
    "designed to be subclassed by other classes.\n",
    "-   It is a class that provides a blueprint for other classes to follow.\n",
    "-   It is a class that defines a common interface for a group of related classes.\n",
    "    -       Example:\n",
    "    -       from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "    -       class Animal(ABC):\n",
    "    -           @abstractmethod\n",

    "    -           def make_sound(self):\n",
    "    -               print(\"Woof!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    -       # animal = Animal()  # This will raise an error because Animal is abstract\n",
    "    -       dog = Dog()\n",
    "    -       dog.make_sound()  #Outputs: Woof!\n",
    "\n",

    "contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "####    17.What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
    "-   A class variable is a variable that is shared by all instances of a class.\n",
    "-   An instance variable is a variable that is unique to each instance of a class.\n",
    "-   A class variable is defined inside a class definition, while an instance variable is defined inside a\n",
    "method definition.\n",
    "    -       Example:\n",

    "superclasses.\n",
    "-   It is a way to inherit behavior from multiple classes.\n",
    "-   It is a way to create a class that has multiple parents.\n",
    "-   Multiple inheritance occurs when a class is derived from more than one base class. This allows a class to inherit behaviors from multiple classes.\n",
    "-   It can be useful, but Python's method resolution order (MRO) ensures that ambiguity is resolved.\n",

    "-   This allows a child class to provide a different implementation of a method than its parent class.\n",
    "-   The child class can also add new methods or attributes that are not present in the parent class When a method is called on an instance of a child class, Python will first look for the method in the child class. If it is not found, it will then look for it in\n",
